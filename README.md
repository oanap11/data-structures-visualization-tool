## Overview
This Java desktop application offers interactive animations for:
  - Singly Linked List
  - Circular Singly Linked List
  - Queue (Array and Linked List)
  - Stack (Array and Linked List)
  - Binary Search Tree
  - Dijkstra and A* Pathfinding Algorithms

## Features
- Visualize data structure operations.
- Observe pathfinding algorithms in action.
- Simple user interface for easy interaction.

## Database (Optional)
Setting up a database is optional and only needed for login and registration features. To enable these you need to set environment variables:
- DB_URL: JDBC URL for your database connection
- DB_USER: Database username
- DB_PASSWORD: Database password

Supported databases: Any SQL database compatible with JDBC (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) based on the DB_URL and driver you configure.
To skip the database setup simply run Main.

## Purpose
Built in the first half of 2022, this app started as a Frankenstein monster of code which I refactored as I gained more experience as a developer. 
It serves as a playground for refactoring techniques, so suggestions for improvements are always welcome. üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
